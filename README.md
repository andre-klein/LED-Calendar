# LED-Calendar


In this code, the LedControl library is used to control the LED matrix. The setup function initializes the LED matrix by setting the shutdown mode, the intensity, and clearing the display. The loop function updates the LED matrix to show the current date by getting the current day from the getCurrentDay function, and then turning on the corresponding LEDs.

Note: The getCurrentDay function is a dummy function for this example and should be replaced with actual code to get the current day from the system's clock or from some other source.
